== lua bindings for Newt

https://github.com/SnarkyClark/luanewt[luanewt] provides simple lua bindings for
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_(programming_library)[Newt], a programming library
for color text mode, widget-based user interfaces. 

NOTE: Here are LADI project modifications of bindings that https://github.com/DavidFeng/lnewt[work with Lua 5.3] (and 5.4). A https://waf.io/[waf build system] is provided as alternative to the original Makefile (uses pkg-config).
